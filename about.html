## About me

I love understanding computers. I think they are fascinating. The idea of breaking into computers is compelling because it’s almost similar to understanding how a person thinks which I find often difficult. I love understanding people, I still find it difficult to do. I am also a learning enthusiast. I try to hog information and then think a lot about it. I try to break and make things. Sometimes, I succeed, sometimes, I don’t. I keep trying… 

Other than that, as it is broadly visible from my page, I am a huge Potterhead. I think it was a great idea in my childhood that I started reading books. If you feel you have something that I would like, you can email me anytime.
